# Billing System

## Description
This project is a prototype billing system for a fast food chain. It allows users to log in, input item prices, apply VAT and discounts, calculate the total amount to be paid, and determine the change. The system terminates when the user types "quit" or "QUIT" in the console.

## Concepts Used

### 1. Variables
- **Purpose:** To store various data such as user ID, password, item prices, number of items, VAT rate, discount percentage, total amount, payment amount, and change.

### 2. Conditional Statements
- **Purpose:** To handle decision-making processes, such as whether to apply VAT, applying discounts, and determining if the user input is "quit" or "QUIT".

### 3. Loops
- **Purpose:** To iterate through the items entered by the user to calculate the total price and to handle repeated prompts such as entering item prices.

### 4. Arrays/Arraylist
- **Purpose:** To store the prices of multiple items that the user inputs.

### 5. Input/Output
- **Purpose:** To interact with the user, including reading user inputs from the console and displaying the output.
